Day One.

1am - Stayed up late reading "How to Do Nothing: Resisting the Attention Economy," by Jenny Odell on my Libby app, which I get free access to through the public library. Love this book so far. I have a couple others on "My Shelf" -- a feature of the app which shows all my loans.

3am - Check into Sanvello. I have free premium membership due to COVID-19 until January 2021. I'm enjoying it. I use many mental health apps but this one is nice and incorporates CBT-based tools right on the offset.

3:30am - I induce sleep with Headspace. A lot of people do this now. I have free premium access to Headspace as well...and I'm going through phases where I use it a lot and use it a little. I like it, I'm going to keep using it. Headspace Move dropped last last week focusing on moving meditation and I really want to try it. Headspace gave away this access also due to COVID-19.

Noon, 12pm - I wake up at 11-something but made pourover and started my day later, not glancing at the clock til it was well after noon. This isn't typical. Often, I don't sleep past sunrise but when I have it in me, I do. I guzzle my coffee glued to the computer for the rest of the day. According to the calculation, my coffee costs less than $1 per day...but right now, since it is a blend of gifted beans, and I didn't even buy the cream, it cost me nothing. Even my coffee mug was free. I write and push stuff to my blogs all day.

5pm - Two weeks ago, I began making use of Digital Wellbeing on my Google Pixel 2 XL, a phone I've had since 2016 but broke a couple days ago. Just the screen. In ten million places. Digital Wellbeing allowed me to set timers on all my apps and basically I don't waste time anymore on my phone on social media or anywhere else really. My phone disturbs me much less. I break at 5, check the phone, and meet up with my friend and his family for dinner. When they're in the country, we do this every day.

8pm - Practice. I give soccer lessons, so I tear myself again away and meet up with my player who lives down the street. We walk to the park and play soccer for an hour and 30 minutes. I get home before 10.

10:30pm - Sit down to chill for the first time all day.

11:30pm - Shower and get in bed. Stay up on my phone for a few hours...reading "Pain Studies" by Lisa Olstein, and browsing the web.

3:00am - Fall asleep at last.

Daily Total: An estimated $1,000 to replace my phone :( If I just replace the screen ~$250. If I downgrade, $500.


Day Two.

12:30pm - Powering up. I'm a regular, it's the pourover with cream...my Chromebook. I spend hours researching business and investment opportunities. I am an entrepreneur and work with partners as well. It's stressful when I'm on the phone til 3pm and my attention is divided. I try to chill for a couple hours. My friend's mom and sister bring sweet yummy drinks from an Austin shop, much tastier than my utilitarian brew.

6pm - Thunderstorms, I'm supposed to train another player at 7pm but predict our practice will get rained out. I spend some time outdoors in my secret garden. I come inside and take the plunge, opening a Roth IRA and investing it all in index funds. I use Libby to put a hold on "The Bogleheads' Guide to Investing." $3000

7:30pm - It's Friday night! I just relax, returning Snapchats from five weeks ago. I eat spicy soup with my friend and his family.

11:00pm - I travel to my parents house to spend a week there. I arrive and go through both my rooms slowly and carefully, looking at everything...all my books and paintings. My brain is playing memories in my head.

1:00am - I read "The Importance of Being Earnest," by Oscar Wilde. I do a little writing and acting. I invent some amazing comedy, come up with amazing ideas for shows, cartoons and films. I'm loving the creativity...I should have recorded the whole event. 

4:00am - I use Headspace when I'm trying to hit the hay. I fall into a dreamy asleep.

Daily Total: $3000


Day Three.

2pm - Saturday. Peel myself out of bed lol. I look great! While I was sleeping, my sister bought donuts from a well-known haunt. She was gone by the time I woke up. I open my mouth and pour a milky cup of instant coffee down my throat. My grandma and mom are watching Punjabi movies and I'm excited to watch a Hindi film next. I check all my mail and do the necessary recyling and sorting. I eat some kadhi, a delicious Indian dish.

8pm - I get some craft-ish beers from the grocery store and cat food for my honey, who is spending the week with me here at my parents. I eat dinner with my family. By the night, we're all chillin. $20

1:00am - Alone time.

4am - Finally sleep.

Daily Total: $20


Day Four.

12pm - My cat wakes me up at 7am but I camp til noon. I do the milky frothy sugary coffee I always do when I'm here. I read til about 5pm and then have dinner: a classic daal, rice and dhai plate, a Punjabi meal recognized commonly as lentil soup, rice, and yogurt. It's gingery and hot. I'm happy.

5pm - I start catching up on a course I'm taking towards a freecodecamp certification. I make another milky coffee to get lit while.

8pm - Codeacademy gave me a free Pro membership so I log on and start doing my Python 3 course and NLP. This was made available and awarded to me due to COVID-19. I eat some Godiva chocolates, I mess around on my phone which hasn't so much as chirped all day, and break for an hour of restorative yoga at 10pm.

12am - I take to all the notebooks I own, defining goals for different lengths of times. I spend some time thinking, and then I start drawing in a sketchbook.

3:15am - I meditate til I fall asleep.
