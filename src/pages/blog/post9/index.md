Occupation: Uhhhhh 
Industry: uhhhhh
Age: 29.5
Location: Austin
Salary: Ummm
Net Worth: Not sure, but I feel pretty worthless based on the above.
Debt: I don't have debt but I may have medical bills in collection. No te preoccupes, my credit score is nearly perfect.
Paycheck Amount: N/A
Pronouns: She/her/hers

Monthly Expenses
Rent: I don't pay rent, but I work on the property where I live, where I did a landscape redesign and add value by working on the garden, xeriscaping, cultivating fruit trees and flowers, and developing the property as much as I can. $0
Utilities: I don't pay utilities, but I implement strategies to save on utilities and I'm pretty dedicated to being energy-efficient and conservative. $0
Internet: I don't pay internet. $0
Savings: For the last few months, I've been saving about $4k a month. Normally, I don't, though.
Mobile: I don't pay for my cell phone but my sister asked me to contribute. About a week ago, I told her I would chip in but I haven't paid anything yet. $0
Streaming Services: Currently using a free trial of HBO which I'm cancelling before the first bill. $0, share Netflix with the homies and get Kanopy through my public library...I have a Spotify Premium through a family plan...unsure who pays it. I don't have Amazon or Prime...I'm very anti-Amazon, I don't use it at all and never have. $0
Student Loans: I had less than $20K in students loans which were discharged due to permanent disability. $0
Health Insurance: I have private insurance but I don't pay for it. $0
Car Insurance: It's lumped in with my parents who cover my siblings and I. $0
Gym: $0. If I want to use machines, I use a key my brother gave me to the fitness center of his old apartments. He no longer lives there but the key still works...it's not electric. It's 10 minutes away by car so I never go there. My boyfriend's little sister has weights in the garage where we live. She lives part of the year in the US and part of the year in Mexico. When she leaves, this week actually, I'll probably start using it. Otherwise I work out outside or indoors on my opalescent Manduka PROlite purchased back in 2016. I started doing free YouTube workouts.
Retirement: I'm opening a Roth IRA this week but I haven't made any contributions to it.

Day One.

1am - Stayed up late reading "How to Do Nothing: Resisting the Attention Economy," by Jenny Odell on my Libby app, which I get access to from my public library. Love this book so far.

3am - Checked into Sanvello. I got free premium membership due to COVID-19 until January 2021. I think I would have been able to get it through my insurance, BCBS, too. I love this app. I use a bunch of mental health apps but this oneis

11am - Can you
