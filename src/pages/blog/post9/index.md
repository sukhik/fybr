Monthly Expenses

Rent: I don't pay rent but I work on my property all the time. I redesigned the landscape, transformed the interior and exterior. I continue adding value by working on the garden, xeriscaping, cultivating fruit trees and flowers, planting stuff, and developing the property as much as I can. $200

Utilities: I don't pay utilities. I am trying to permanently reduce the bill. That's equivalent to paying a portion of the bill, isn't it? $0

Internet: I don't pay internet. $0

I have Spotify Premium through a family plan. I don't have Amazon or Prime...I'm very anti-Amazon, I don't use it at all and never have. $0 O WAIT. I got charged by CBS to watch the NWSL Challenge Cup over july. I did pay $10 but it's canceled now. Literally, I just cancelled it.

Gym: $0. If I want to use machines, I use a key my brother gave me to the fitness center of his old apartments. He no longer lives there but the key still works...it's not electric. It's 10 minutes away by car and everyone is under quarantine so I never go there but I wish I did. My boyfriend's sister has weights in the garage where we live. She lives part of the year here and part of the year outside of the country. When she leaves, I'll probably start using her equipment. I own my own weights as well, I believe they belong to my other brother, but they are at my parents house. I need to lift! I work out outside for free or indoors on my opalescent Manduka PROlite purchased back in 2016. I started doing free YouTube workouts...Really loving YouTube, except for all the bad parts..$0

Self-Care + Vacation Fund: I'm starting to put $100 away per month for myself to use whenever I want on whatever.


Day One.

1am - Stayed up late reading "How to Do Nothing: Resisting the Attention Economy," by Jenny Odell on my Libby app, which I get access to for free through my public library. Love this book so far. I have a couple others on "My Shelf" -- a feature of the app which shows all my loans.

3am - Checked into Sanvello. I have free premium membership due to COVID-19 until January 2021. I think I would have been able to get it for free through my insurance, though too. I'm enjoying it. I have used many mental health apps in the past but this one is nice and incorporates CBT-based tools right on the offset.

3:30am - I use a sleep-inducing meditation on Headspace to drift to sleep. A lot of people do this now. I have free premium access to Headspace as well...and I'm going through phases where I use it a lot and use it a little. I like it, I'm going to keep using it. Headspace Move dropped last last week focusing on moving meditation and I really want to try it. Headspace gave away this access also due to COVID-19.

Noon, 12pm - I woke up at 11-something but made pourover and started my day a bit after, not glancing at the clock til it was well afternoon. This isn't typical, there are weeks I can't sleep past sunrise but for the last couple days I haven't. I slurp down my coffee and stay on the computer for the rest of the day. According to my man, our cups of coffee cost less than $1 per day anyway...but right now, our coffee is a blend of gifted beans, some from a local roaster mixed with a bag of Starbucks Coffee from my boyfriend's dad. We usually pay for the beans or at least the cream, but this time, even his mom picked up half-and-half for us at the grocery store last time she went. I stay the course, writing and pushing stuff to all my blogs.

5pm - Two weeks ago, I began making use of Digital Wellbeing on my Google Pixel 2 XL, a phone I've had since 2016 but broke a couple days ago. Just the screen. In ten million places. Digital Wellbeing allowed me to set timers on all my apps and basically I don't waste time anymore on my phone on social media or anywhere else really. My phone disturbs me much less. I break at 5, check the phone, and meet up with my boyfriend and his family for dinner. When they're in the country, we do this every day.

8pm - Practice. I give soccer lessons, so I tear myself again away and meet up with my player who lives down the street. We walk to the park and play soccer for an hour and 30 minutes. I get home before 10.

10:30pm - Sit down to chill for the first time all day.

11:30pm - Shower and get in bed. Stay up on my phone for a few hours...reading "Pain Studies" by Lisa Olstein.

3:00am - Fall asleep at last.

Daily Total: An estimated $1,000 to replace my phone :( If I just replace the screen ~$250. If I downgrade, $500.


Day Two.

12:30pm - Powering up. I'm a regular, it's the pourover with cream...my Chromebook. I spend a couple hours researching business and investment opportunities. I am the entrepreneur but I work with other partners. It's stressful when I'm on the phone til 3pm and my attention is split. I'm experiencing angst so I try to chill for the next couple hours. Pepe's mom and sister come home bringing sweet yummy drinks from an Austin shop, much tastier than my utilitarian brew.

6pm - Thunderstorms, I'm supposed to train another player at 7pm but predict our practice will get rained out. I spend some time outdoors in my secret garden. I come inside and take the plunge, opening a Roth IRA and investing in index mutual funds. I use Libby to put a hold on "The Bogleheads' Guide to Investing." $3000

7:30pm - It's Friday night! I just relax, returning Snapchats from five weeks ago. I eat spicy Mexican soup with my boyfriend's family.

11:00pm - I drive home to my parents house to spend the weekend there. I go through both my rooms looking at everything...all my books and paintings. My brain is playing memories in my head.

1:00am - I read "The Importance of Being Earnest," by Oscar Wilde. I do a little writing and acting. I invent amazing comedy routines, amazing ideas for shows, cartoons and films. I'm loving the creativity...I should have recorded this whole event. I think about representation in the media. I'm dying to influence...

4:00am - I use Headspace. Eventually I fall asleep.

Daily Total: $3000


Day Three.

2pm - Saturday. Peel myself out of bed lol. I look great! My sister bought donuts from a well-known haunt. I open my mouth and pour a milky cup of instant coffee down my throat. My grandma and mom are watching Punjabi movies and I'm excited to watch a Hindi film next. I check all my mail and do the necessary recyling, shredding and sorting. I eat some kadhi, which is a delicious Indian dish.

11pm - I drank three craft-ish beers earlier from the grocery store. Ate dinner with my family. I brang my cat over and bought him some food. We're all chillin. $20

1:00am - Alone time. I guess that's how it is when you're breaking up.

4am - Finally sleep.

Daily Total: $20


Day Four.
