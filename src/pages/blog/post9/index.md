![photo](post9photo1.png)

Occupation: Uhhhhh

Industry: uhhhhh

Age: 29.5

Location: Austin

Salary: Ummm

Net Worth: Not sure. Sometimes I feel pretty worthless.

Debt: I don't have debt but I may have medical bills in collection. No te preoccupes, my credit score is nearly perfect.

Paycheck Amount: N/A

Pronouns: She/her/hers


Monthly Expenses

Rent: I don't pay rent, but I work on the property where I live. I redesigned the landscape, transformed the interior and exterior. I continue adding value by working on the garden, xeriscaping, cultivating fruit trees and flowers, and developing the property as much as I can. $0

Utilities: I don't pay utilities. I am trying to permanently reduce the bill for posterity. That's equivalent to paying a portion of the bill, isn't it? $0

Internet: I don't pay internet. $0

Savings: For the last few months, I've been saving about $2k a month. Normally, I don't. $0

Mobile: I don't pay for my cell phone but my sister asked me to contribute. About a week ago, I told her I would chip in but haven't paid anything yet. $0

Streaming Services: Currently using a free trial of HBO which I won't use past the first bill. I share Netflix with the homies and get Kanopy through the public library. I have Spotify Premium through a family plan. I don't have Amazon or Prime...I'm very anti-Amazon, I don't use it at all and never have. $0 O WAIT. I got charged by CBS to watch the NWSL Challenge Cup over july. I did pay $10 but it's canceled now. Literally, I just cancelled it.

Student Loans: I had less than $20K in students loans which were discharged due to permanent disability. $0

Health Insurance: I have private insurance but I don't pay for it. $0

Car Insurance: It's lumped in with my parents who cover my siblings and I. $0

Gym: $0. If I want to use machines, I use a key my brother gave me to the fitness center of his old apartments. He no longer lives there but the key still works...it's not electric. It's 10 minutes away by car and everyone is under quarantine so I never go there but I wish I did. My boyfriend's little sister has weights in the garage where we live. She lives part of the year here in the US and part of the year outside of the country. When she leaves, this week actually, I'll probably start using her equipment. Otherwise I work out outside for free or indoors on my opalescent Manduka PROlite purchased back in 2016. I actually own my own weights as well, I believe they belong to my other brother, but they are at my parents house. I started doing free YouTube workouts...Really loving YouTube, except for all the bad parts..$0

Retirement: I'm opening a Roth IRA this week but I haven't made any contributions to it. $0

Construction: I'm making a back house on the property. It will cost $1000 per month for the next 4 months. Interior design, furniture and decor not included.

Self-Care + Vacation Fund: I'm starting to put $100 away per month for myself to use whenever I want on whatever.

Day One.

1am - Stayed up late reading "How to Do Nothing: Resisting the Attention Economy," by Jenny Odell on my Libby app, which I get access to through my public library. Love this book so far. I have a couple others on "My Shelf" -- a feature of the app which shows all my loans from the library.

3am - Checked into Sanvello. I have free premium membership due to COVID-19 until January 2021. I think I would have been able to get it through my insurance, BCBS, too. I'm enjoying this app. I have used a bunch of mental health apps in the past but this one is nice and incorporates CBT-based tools right at the offset.

3:30am - I use a sleep-inducing meditation on Headspace to drift to sleep. I think a lot of people do this. I have free premium access to Headspace as well...and I'm going through phases where I use it a lot and use it a little. I like it, I'm going to keep using it. "Headspace Move" dropped last last week focused on moving meditation and I really want to try it. Headspace gave me this access also due to COVID-19.

Noon, 12pm - I woke up at 11 something but I made pourover and started my day a bit after, not glancing at the clock til it was well afternoon. This isn't typical, there are weeks I can't sleep past sunrise but for the last couple days I haven't been able to get up. Last week I had a blow out with my family who upsets me with their politics. It exhausted me. I let myself do what I want now. This whole week, I love on myself, baby myself, listen to myself. I sip (smash) my coffee and get on the computer...I stay on the computer for the rest of the day. According to my man, my cup of coffee costs less than $1 per day anyway...but right now, our coffee is a blend of gifted beans, some from a local roaster mixed with a bag of Starbucks Coffee my boyfriend's dad bought. We usually pay for the beans or at least the cream, but this time, even his mom picked up half-and-half for us at the grocery store last time she went. I drink that coffee, I write and push stuff to all my blogs.

5pm - Two weeks ago, I made use of Digital Wellbeing Beta on my Google Pixel 2 XL, a phone I've had since 2016 but broke a couple days ago. Just the screen. In ten million places. Digital Wellbeing allowed me to set timers on all my apps and basically I don't waste time anymore on my phone on social media or anywhere else really. My phone is disturbing me much less. I break at 5, check the phone, and meet up with my boyfriend, and his mom and sister for dinner. When they're in the country, we do this every day. They leave tomorrow, so who knows how we're going to feed ourselves after that.

8pm - Practice. See <a href=https://sclub.netlify.app>my training site</a>! I give soccer lessons, so I break again from what I'm doing to meet up with my player who lives down the street. We walk to the park and play soccer for an hour and 30 minutes. I get home before 10.

10:30pm - Sit down to chill for the first time all day.

11:30pm -

Daily Total: An estimated $1,000 to replace my phone :(


Day Two.
