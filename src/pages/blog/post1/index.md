I'm 29. It's 2020. Next January, in 7 months I'll be thirty. For fifteen years I was in college and university. I earned gorgeous-looking, pretty reductive degrees in December 2018 and 2019. I live in the States...the United States of America. It's the YouTube era and I'm starting blogs.

Slippery, I've gone through most of life without applying myself. When I was small, I was okay and did splendidly. As an adult, I've had to face the music. Over the last ten years, I started solving my problems - just the lowest hanging fruit. After five years of this, a cadence bathed my work and I grew resilient. Rapid. I gained the ability to develop worldly solutions and orchestrate them across diverse areas where my problems were coming from. New problems came up all the time. Like a machine or as if I were in a game, I solved them. Looking back, I find I have a lot to say. A lot to share. Looking at just this writing, I notice a gap in the story, from between being young to the time I'm getting it all together. What happened between ages 9 and 19? 10 and 21? 23-25, 26-29? I've wisened up, but there is a lot I don't know. Only few things are certain. My name is Aur and I've got problems.

I'm using this blog as a tool. I already went through a lot of self-development but I feel like I'm just getting started. I don't really know what I did, how, or why, in words or language. I listened to myself and governed myself. I went through a profound amount of harrowing situations, the worst film I've ever seen, and came out alive. What motivated me? How did I know what to do? Where am I now? What's next for me? Can I do it again? Would I do it again? 

I'm currently processing the past. I'm learning how to chill. FYBR is the perfect tool with the perfect name. After everything, all my life so far, and all my problems, this is my First Year Being Rich.

## Money

I'm going to be extremely clear. Money is very important and it's central to why I am writing FYBR. It isn't "the what," though. Throughout my past, I've shown I have the habit of saving, and having no money for most of my formative life, I don't buy things even now or go for any kind of shopping. The shopping I do is special and will definitely be a subject here. I mean, why else do we even have money? 

The what is a little grander, much more elusive and marvelous, being that it has to do with me, with us, with the way we spend our time on Earth. It has to do with willpower, self-knowledge, single-mindedness, perseverence and desire. It has to do with change: changing yourself. I don't want to freak anyone out, but we have to ask ourselves what we are doing, all the time, and ask ourselves why.

## C'est Parti

To lay it all out. In 2018, I started investing. In 2020, I'll be kicking it up. I think keeping a record will serve me and serve others. Other things I'm doing include saving my time, energy, and money, and living a full life. My goal is to be the picture of perfect health, and all I want is money in the bank. I want to be free. I guess this blog is about freedom.
